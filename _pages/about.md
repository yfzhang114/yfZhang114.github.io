I'm the first year PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. [Tieniu Tan](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tantieniu). I have also spent time at Microsoft, advised by Prof. [Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/).

**Research Interests**

* Computer Vision: Pedestrian Re-IDentification, Object Detection, Deep Generative Models
* Machine Learning: Causal Inference, Out of Distribution Generalization, Domain Adaptation
* Internet of Things: CrowdSourcing, Incentive Mechanism Design

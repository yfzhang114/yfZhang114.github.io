I'm a third-year PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Prof. [Tieniu Tan](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~tantieniu). I have also spent time at Microsoft, advised by Prof. [Jingdong Wang](https://jingdongwang2017.github.io/), alibaba DAMO Academy, work with Prof. [Rong Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CS5uNscAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).    I strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential it holds for driving impactful research outcomes. *If you are interested in partnering on research projects, offering internship opportunities or exchange programs, I would be thrilled to connect with you*.

My research focuses on the development of **robust and reliable machine learning (ML) systems** capable of effectively managing unexpected inputs and distribution shifts. Additionally, my work aims to establish foundational principles for constructing systems that can be depended upon in real-world scenarios, especially when deploying **large pretrained multimodal models and language models**. This includes ensuring these systems maintain high performance and reliability under varied and unforeseen conditions, thereby enhancing their practical applicability and trustworthiness.
